Name of character: Colin

This is the best of times, this is the worst of times. It is the age of intelligence, it is the age of foolishness. We are all going direct to Heaven, we are all going direct to hell. Colin can only shiver in excitement and despair for the dreadful and bright future ahead.

People always forget that they need to enjoy their lives. They just want to be
depressed and say that life is hard. But look around! You are alive, you have
a chance to become a better person than you are right now. You have a chance
to become happy.
