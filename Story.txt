Name of character: Colin

This is the best of times, this is the worst of times. It is the age of intelligence, it is the age of foolishness. We are all going direct to Heaven, we are all going direct to hell. Colin can only shiver in excitement and despair for the dreadful and bright future ahead.

People always forget that they need to enjoy their lives. They just want to be
depressed and say that life is hard. But look around! You are alive, you have
a chance to become a better person than you are right now. You have a chance
to become happy.

Even with all of the bad in the world, there is still good. Yes, there is war
and violence, but there also exists kindness, generosity, and happiness. The
fate of the world lies on the balance of these two: good and evil. It is up to
us to decide how the world should proceed.

It doesn't matter how fast light can travel, because darkness will always be there 
waiting for it. Conversely, no matter how long there is darkness, the light will
eventually make its way there and illuminate it. As long as we are able to hold out
for the light, we will triumph.

The duality of the current situation confused him, and the unpredictable future make him uneasy. 
When the time of change comes, should one throw himself into the fire, or watch the world burn?
He doesn't have a answer to this question, or all the other questions. He is merely a simple man trying to stay alive.
Finally, he give up thinking, and let himself be consumed by the void.
